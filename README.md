#Main Achievements:
The main tasks of this project are divided into three parts: Face verification algorithm implementation, face-swapping algorithm implementation, and cross-platform mobile application development.
1. The tasks of the face verification experiment are divided into three parts: dataset annotation, preprocessing of face images, and completion of the loss function.
2. Cross-platform mobile application development adopts a front-end and back-end separation approach, with the front-end developed using Uniapp. It realizes the generation of face-swapping videos and face verification through the mini-program.
